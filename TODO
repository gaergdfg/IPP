MAKE THE available_fields COUNTING METHOD

*mucho importanto*
1.	we're looking at get_neighbour_count of adjacent fields to the one we changed
	if it's >1 we don't change the ones that are adjacent, else we're increasing
	the ones that require a new area to be claimed

*not so mucho importanto*
1. add field_manager() to gamma_move() ?
